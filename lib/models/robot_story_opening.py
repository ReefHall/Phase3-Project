                                                        As a curious and determined individual who has always been interested in technology.

                                        You have been tinkering with computers since childhood, and as you grew older, your interest in coding grew with you.

                                As you continually improve your skills, you began to dream of building something remarkable - something that could change the world.

                                                           And then, one day, you had an idea that was so revolutionary it took your breath away.

                                                                      You would build a program that could bring a robot to life!

                                                                      Excited by the possibility, you set to work on the project.

                                                            You worked tirelessly, pouring all your knowledge and creativity into the code.
